The **run_analysis.R** script is composed of six (6) major phases with the following functionality:  

**Phase 1** is designed to merge the training and the test sets to create one data set. It has three (3) sub-phases with the following functionality:  
+ *Phase 1.1* reads the training and its corresponding subject and activity label files and merge it into one tidy data set named mergedTrainingSet.  
+ *Phase 1.2* reads the testing and its corresponding subject and activity label files and merge it into one tidy data set named mergedTestingSet.  
+ *Phase 1.3* merges the training and testing tidy data sets into one and name it as mergedDataSet.  

**Phase 2**  is designed to extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement in mergedDataSet. . It has three (3) sub-phases with the following functionality:  
+ *Phase 2.1* reads the file feature.txt and calls the getMeanStdCol() function to extract the index of the mean and standard deviation columns. The indices were then assigned to meanStdIndex.  
+ *Phase 2.2* combines the indices in meanStdIndex as well as the subject and activity indices, respectively.  
+ *Phase 2.3* extracts the necessary columns and assign it to filteredDataSet.  

**Phase 3** is designed to appropriately label the data set (filteredDataSet) with descriptive variable names taken from the features.txt file.  

**Phase 4** is designed to assign a descriptive activity name for every activity in the filteredDataSet through the following phases:  
+ *Phase 4.1* reads the activity_labels.txt file to create a lookup table (activityLabels).  
+ *Phase 4.2* assign the appropriate activity label based on the values in the lookup table.  

**Phase 5** is designed to create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject using the dataset that was produced in *Phase 4*.  

**Phase 6** is the final phase and is designed to save the tidy data set produced from *Phase 5* in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.
